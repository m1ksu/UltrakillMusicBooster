# Ultrakill Music Booster
Allows you to boost Ultrakill's music to excruciating volumes!

Ultrakill's soundtrack is great, but even at max volume it gets quite drowned out by the game sounds. This mod makes it so that the old 100% is now 80%, and the new 100% is +20db to the audio! That's pretty loud!

Prepare thy ears, if you use this. Hearing damage is not a joke. I wouldn't go above 90% music volume unless master volume is really low.

## Installation

1. Install BepInEx by following [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=meNiXcbPh_s)
2. Go to the releases tab and download the .dll file
3. Place the .dll file into <Your Ultrakill Directory>/BepInEx/plugins.
4. Lower your volume before you start the game. Just in case.
5. That's all!
